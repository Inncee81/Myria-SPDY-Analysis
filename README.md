Myria-SPDY-Analysis
===================

A Dependency tree analysis of SPDY.

Originally implemented in Perl, but I used Python to implement/instaniate the proper tables. The creation of the dependency trees will 'hopefully' be written in MyriaL.

To create the dependency trees/graphs, take the files from the wprof folder inside the data folder and run tablescript.py. This generates the necessary tables needed for futher use.
