My understanding of what this program is doing.

Given data that is organized into Objects, Resources, HOL, Computation, and Preload. The program sifts through the data and finds various paths regarding load time under various conditions.

The objects are the tag names written in the HTML page like div, a, img, etc. It is hashed into a table. It has the row and column number, time, position, the chunk length, and wether or not it is a start tag.

Calling structure
	Analyze.pl -> ProcessMain.pm -> RawParser.pm -> Dependency.pm
